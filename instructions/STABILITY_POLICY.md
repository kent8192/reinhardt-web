# Stability Policy

## Purpose

This document defines the stability guarantees and versioning policies for the Reinhardt project across its lifecycle phases: alpha, release candidate (RC), and stable. These rules ensure predictable API stability for downstream users and guide contributors on what changes are permitted during each phase.

## Version Lifecycle

Reinhardt follows a three-phase lifecycle for each release:

```
alpha (0.1.0-alpha.N) → RC (0.1.0-rc.N) → stable (0.1.0)
```

| Phase | Version Format | API Stability | Permitted Changes |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Alpha | `0.1.0-alpha.N` | No guarantees | Any change (features, breaking changes, experiments) |
| RC | `0.1.0-rc.N` | Frozen | Bug fixes only; breaking changes require explicit approval |
| Stable | `0.1.0` | Guaranteed | Follows SemVer strictly |

### VL-1 (MUST): Monotonic Progression

Versions MUST progress monotonically through the lifecycle:
- Alpha versions increment: `alpha.1` → `alpha.2` → ... → `alpha.N`
- RC versions increment: `rc.1` → `rc.2` → ... → `rc.N`
- Stable is the final target: `rc.N` → `0.1.0`
- **NEVER** regress from RC back to alpha

### VL-2 (MUST): Per-Crate Versioning

Each crate in the workspace follows its own lifecycle independently. One crate may be in RC while another is still in alpha.

---

## Alpha Phase

### AP-1: No Stability Guarantees

During the alpha phase (`0.1.0-alpha.N`):

- Public APIs may change without notice
- Breaking changes do not require special approval
- New features, experiments, and refactoring are all permitted
- APIs may be added, modified, or removed freely

### AP-2: Deprecation Before Removal

APIs deprecated during alpha **MAY** be removed when transitioning to RC. Deprecation warnings should be present for at least one alpha release before removal.

---

## RC Phase

The RC phase is a stabilization period. The primary goal is to validate the API surface and fix bugs before the stable release.

### SP-1 (MUST): API Freeze

During the RC phase (`0.1.0-rc.N`):

- **NO** new public API additions (structs, traits, functions, methods, modules)
- **NO** new feature flags
- **NO** new public re-exports
- Private/internal APIs may still be modified if they do not affect the public surface

**Rationale:** The RC phase validates the existing API surface. Adding new APIs during RC undermines this validation and introduces untested surface area.

### SP-2 (MUST): Bug-Fix-Only Policy

Only the following changes are permitted during RC:

| Permitted | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Bug fixes | Fix incorrect behavior, panics, data corruption |
| Documentation fixes | Typo corrections, clarification of existing docs |
| Test additions | Additional test coverage for existing functionality |
| Performance fixes | Optimization of existing behavior (no API changes) |
| Dependency updates | Security patches, bug fix versions only |

| NOT Permitted | Examples |
|---------------|----------|
| New features | New API endpoints, new configuration options |
| API additions | New public methods, new public types |
| Refactoring | Code restructuring that changes public interfaces |
| New dependencies | Adding new crate dependencies |

### SP-3 (MUST): Breaking Changes Require Approval

Breaking changes during RC are **strongly discouraged** and only permitted for:

1. **Critical bugs** that cannot be fixed without an API change
2. **Security vulnerabilities** that require API modification
3. **Soundness issues** that make the existing API unsafe

**Approval Process:**

1. Create a GitHub issue using the API Change Proposal template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/8-api_change.yml`)
2. Label with `critical` and `rc-migration`
3. Document the technical justification for why a non-breaking fix is impossible
4. Obtain explicit maintainer approval before implementing
5. Update all affected documentation and migration guides

### SP-4 (MUST): Deprecation Policy

- APIs deprecated during alpha **MAY** be removed when entering RC
- APIs deprecated during RC **MUST** survive until the next major version (`0.2.0`)
- New deprecations during RC are permitted only to mark APIs that will be removed in the next major version
- All deprecations MUST use `#[deprecated(since = "version", note = "reason")]`

**Example:**
```rust
// Deprecated in alpha, removed in RC - ALLOWED
// (was: pub fn old_method())

// Deprecated in RC, must survive until 0.2.0
#[deprecated(since = "0.1.0-rc.1", note = "Use `new_method` instead. Will be removed in 0.2.0.")]
pub fn legacy_method() {
	// ...
}
```

### SP-5 (SHOULD): Commit Message Convention for RC

During the RC phase, commit messages should clearly indicate the nature of the fix:

```
fix(scope): description of bug fix

fix(orm): resolve panic when empty query result is returned
fix(auth): correct token expiration calculation off-by-one error
```

Feature commits (`feat:`) are **NOT** permitted during RC (enforced by review).

---

## Stable Phase

### ST-1 (MUST): SemVer Compliance

Once a crate reaches stable (`0.1.0`), it follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) strictly:

- **MAJOR** (`0.x.0` → `0.y.0`): Breaking API changes
- **MINOR** (`0.1.x` → `0.1.y`): New features, backward-compatible
- **PATCH** (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`): Bug fixes only

**Note:** Per SemVer, versions with major version `0` (e.g., `0.1.0`) have relaxed stability rules -- the MINOR version may contain breaking changes. Reinhardt treats `0.1.0` as its first stable release within the `0.x` series and follows the spirit of SemVer for patch releases.

---

## RC to Stable Criteria

### SC-1 (MUST): All Criteria Must Be Met

A crate may transition from RC to stable **only** when ALL of the following criteria are satisfied:

| # | Criterion | Verification Method |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | All CI checks passing | GitHub Actions status |
| 2 | No open critical or high severity bugs | `gh issue list --label critical,high` |
| 3 | Documentation complete for all public APIs | `cargo doc --no-deps` with no warnings |
| 4 | Minimum 2 weeks of RC stability | No critical fixes required during this period |
| 5 | Community testing period completed | At least one RC release publicly available for feedback |
| 6 | All `todo!()` resolved in public APIs | `cargo make clippy-todo-check` passes |
| 7 | CHANGELOG updated for stable release | Reviewed and finalized |

### SC-2 (MUST): Stability Timer Reset

The 2-week stability timer (criterion #4) **resets** whenever:

- A new RC version is published (e.g., `rc.1` → `rc.2`)
- A critical or high severity bug is discovered and fixed
- A breaking change is applied (with approval per SP-3)

**Example Timeline:**
```
rc.1 released          → Timer starts (Day 0)
Critical bug found     → Timer resets (Day 5)
rc.2 released (fix)    → Timer restarts (Day 0)
No issues for 14 days  → Ready for stable (Day 14)
```

### SC-3 (SHOULD): Pre-Release Validation

Before publishing the stable release:

```bash
# Full test suite
cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features

# Documentation check
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --all-features

# Publish dry-run for each crate
cargo publish --dry-run -p <crate-name>

# Check for TODO/FIXME
cargo make clippy-todo-check
```

---

## Version Bump Rules During RC

### VB-1 (MUST): RC Increment for Bug Fixes

When a bug fix is applied during the RC phase:

```
0.1.0-rc.1 → 0.1.0-rc.2 (bug fix)
0.1.0-rc.2 → 0.1.0-rc.3 (another bug fix)
```

Each RC increment MUST:
- Include only bug fixes (per SP-2)
- Update the CHANGELOG with fix descriptions
- Reset the stability timer (per SC-2)

### VB-2 (MUST): Stable Release When Criteria Met

When all SC-1 criteria are satisfied:

```
0.1.0-rc.N → 0.1.0 (stable release)
```

The stable release MUST:
- Include the finalized CHANGELOG
- Be published via the standard release-plz workflow
- Create a Git tag in the format `<crate-name>@v0.1.0`

### VB-3 (NEVER): No Feature Bumps During RC

During the RC phase:
- **NEVER** bump to a new minor or major version
- **NEVER** add `feat:` commits
- **NEVER** introduce new pre-release identifiers (e.g., `0.1.0-rc.1-beta.1`)

---

## Quick Reference

### MUST DO
- Follow the monotonic lifecycle progression: alpha → RC → stable
- Freeze public API surface during RC phase (no new APIs)
- Apply bug-fix-only policy during RC phase
- Obtain explicit maintainer approval for any breaking change during RC
- Use `#[deprecated]` with `since` and `note` fields for all deprecations
- Keep APIs deprecated during RC until the next major version
- Reset the 2-week stability timer on each new RC release
- Meet ALL SC-1 criteria before transitioning to stable
- Increment RC version for each bug fix release (`rc.1` → `rc.2`)
- Use the API Change Proposal template for breaking changes during RC

### NEVER DO
- Regress from RC back to alpha
- Add new public APIs during the RC phase
- Add `feat:` commits during the RC phase
- Remove APIs deprecated during RC before the next major version
- Apply breaking changes during RC without explicit maintainer approval
- Transition to stable without meeting ALL SC-1 criteria
- Skip the 2-week stability period
- Publish stable release with open critical or high severity bugs
- Introduce new pre-release identifiers during RC (e.g., `-beta`)
