# Macro Usage Guidelines

## Purpose

This file defines the policy for using Reinhardt's macros (notably `#[model(...)]` and `form!`) consistently across the codebase.

---

## `#[model(...)]` Macro

### Model Identity Contract

Every model MUST set `app_label` explicitly. The label determines how model
metadata is grouped for migrations, application discovery, and registry
lookups, so there is no implicit `"default"` application.

`table_name` is optional. When omitted, it is derived from the application
label plus the Rust struct name using snake_case without pluralization or
language-specific inflection:

| Struct | Derived table name (`app_label = "app"`) |
|---|---|
| `User` | `app_user` |
| `BlogPost` | `app_blog_post` |
| `HTTPRoute` | `app_http_route` |
| `Person` | `app_person` |

Set `table_name` explicitly when mapping a model to an existing table or when
the database contract requires a different name.

### MU-1 (SHOULD): Do Not Combine with `#[derive(Model)]`

The `#[model(...)]` attribute macro automatically applies `#[derive(Model)]` internally. If `#[derive(Model)]` is *also* written on the same struct, the attribute macro preserves the existing derive and forwards its configuration through a helper attribute. Compilation succeeds today, but the explicit `Model` derive becomes redundant noise that obscures intent.

**Rule:**
- When using `#[model(...)]`, **prefer not** to also write `#[derive(Model)]` on the same struct — the attribute applies it for you.
- Add other derives that `#[model(...)]` does not provide via a separate `#[derive(...)]` (e.g., `Debug`, `Clone`, `serde::Serialize`).
- Existing code that combines both is supported and does not need an immediate fix; use a fully qualified path for the active attribute when retaining the explicit derive, and follow the canonical form in new code.

**Examples:**

```rust
// ✅ Canonical — let #[model(...)] add the Model derive
#[model(app_label = "people")]
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Person {
    pub id: i64,
    pub name: String,
}

// ⚠️ Redundant but supported — qualify the active attribute macro
#[reinhardt::model(app_label = "people", table_name = "people")]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Model)]
pub struct Person {
    pub id: i64,
    pub name: String,
}
```

### MU-2 (MUST): Initialize via the Macro-Generated Builder

The `#[model(...)]` macro generates a typestate builder. `Model::build()` is the canonical initialization path; `Model::new()` is a zero-argument alias for `Model::build()`.

**Rule:**
- Initialize `#[model(...)]` structs using the macro-generated `build()` builder or zero-argument `new()` alias.
- Do not call a positional constructor such as `Person::new(id, name)`. The generated `new()` accepts no arguments.
- Do not initialize them via struct literals (`Person { id: 0, name: ... }`) when the macro-generated builder is available.
- Exception: struct-literal syntax may be used in tests when a test specifically needs to set fields that the constructor auto-fills (e.g., to inject a fixed primary key). Document the reason with a comment.

**Examples:**

```rust
// ✅ Correct — use the macro-generated builder
let person = Person::build()
    .name("Alice")
    .finish();

// ✅ Also correct — new() is a zero-argument alias of build()
let person = Person::new()
    .name("Alice")
    .finish();

// ✅ Correct — opt in to overriding a macro-managed field when importing or
// bridging an externally supplied identity.
let person = Person::build()
    .id(existing_id)
    .name("Alice")
    .finish();

// ❌ Incorrect — bypasses macro-generated initialization
let person = Person {
    id: 1,
    name: "Alice".to_string(),
};
```

**Rationale:**
- The generated builder accepts only the fields the user must supply and auto-fills macro-managed fields (auto-generated primary keys, foreign-key id columns, timestamps, relationship markers). Struct-literal initialization forces the caller to spell out every field, including those the builder would have filled — which is brittle.
- Macro-managed database fields also get optional builder setters. Call those setters only when the caller intentionally needs to preserve an externally supplied value, such as an imported primary key or fixed timestamp; omitting the setter keeps the normal generated/default path.
- Centralizing initialization through the builder keeps call sites stable as the macro evolves: adding a required field surfaces as a named setter instead of changing positional argument order.
- Today the generated builder does not perform validation; this rule is about future-proofing and field coverage, not about a current invariant guarantee.

### MU-3 (SHOULD): Prefer `Model::build()` over `Model::new()`

`Model::new()` remains available as a zero-argument alias for `Model::build()` (issue #4401). Both entry points return the same typestate builder. Prefer `build()` in examples and application code because it names the construction pattern directly.

**When to prefer `build()`:**

- Tutorials, examples, and long-lived application code where the model schema
  is expected to evolve. Adding a new required field surfaces as a new setter
  rather than a new positional parameter that breaks every caller in
  lock-step.
- Code that benefits from passing related models by reference: FK setters
  accept any `IntoPrimaryKey<Related>` value (see #4398), so
  `.author(&user)` is exactly as valid as `.author(user_id)`.

**When `new()` is still appropriate:**

- One-shot test fixtures and tight, internal call sites where the shorter alias
  is clearer.
- Migration windows where existing zero-argument construction examples already
  read naturally.

**Examples:**

```rust
// ✅ Typestate builder — each required field named, ordering free, and
// adding a new required field to `Question` keeps this call site compiling.
let question = Question::build()
    .question_text("What's your favorite color?")
    .finish();

// ✅ Zero-argument alias — returns the same builder.
let question = Question::new()
    .question_text("What's your favorite color?")
    .finish();

// ✅ FK setter accepts `&User` directly (composes with #4398).
let choice = Choice::build()
    .choice_text("Red")
    .votes(0)
    .question(&question)
    .finish();
```

**Type-state guarantees:**

- Each required-field setter transitions exactly one slot from `Unset` to
  `Set`. Setters can be called in any order.
- `finish()` is only available when every required slot is `Set`. Calling
  `finish()` with any remaining required setter unused is a **compile-time
  error**, not a runtime panic.
- Macro-managed fields (`auto_now_add`, FK relation fields, identity /
  auto-increment primary keys) are filled in by `finish()` using the
  macro-managed default expressions — no setter call is required.

**Rationale:**

- DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY #5 ("API ergonomics is paramount"): named setters scale
  with model size in a way positional arguments do not.
- DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY #9 ("Every framework eventually becomes outdated"):
  model schemas evolve; `build()` absorbs that evolution without breaking
  callers.
- DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY #4 ("Fail early"): the per-field type-state lifts
  "required field missing" from a runtime error into a compile error.

### Storage-backed model `FileField`

The storage-backed ORM value is opt-in. Enable the `file-storage` feature and
one provider feature (`file-storage-local`, `file-storage-s3`,
`file-storage-gcs`, or `file-storage-azure`) in the application. Do not use the
storage provider matrix as an application default.

`FileField` declarations require a relative UTC `upload_to` template. The
`file_storage` attribute selects a lowercase storage alias and defaults to
`default`; aliases must be present in `[storage]` settings and support atomic
exclusive creation. The macro emits `Model::file_<field>()` as an explicit
upload descriptor:

```rust
#[model(app_label = "profiles", table_name = "profiles")]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
struct Profile {
    #[field(primary_key = true)]
    id: Option<i64>,
    #[field(
        upload_to = "avatars/%Y/%m/%d",
        file_storage = "private_uploads",
        max_length = 255
    )]
    avatar: db::orm::FileField,
}

let avatar = Profile::file_avatar().store(upload).await?;
let mut profile = Profile::build().avatar(avatar).finish();
profile.save().await?;

let bytes = profile.avatar.open().await?;
let size = profile.avatar.size().await?;
let url = profile.avatar.url().await?;
```

The upload is eager and returns a typed logical reference. The database stores
only the logical path; hydration restores `private_uploads` from generated
field metadata, so the alias is not inferred from a provider-prefixed row.
`url()` uses the alias's configured expiry and `url_with_expiry` accepts an
explicit duration. Initialize `reinhardt::file_storage` before storing or
opening a value and retain its RAII activation guard.

The lower-level `store` operation is eager. For model mutations, use the
coordinator APIs described in the ORM documentation: staged objects are
compensated when persistence fails. Old-object cleanup is disabled by default;
set `cleanup = true` only when the field exclusively owns its storage objects.
Compensation remains enabled. With the admin `file-uploads` feature,
FileField and ImageField form submissions use multipart mutations with the same
validation and cleanup policy.

## Quick Reference

### Partial indexes

Declare a non-unique partial index on a field with `index = true` and a SQL
predicate in `condition`. Relationship fields resolve to their generated
database column, such as `user_id`.

```rust
#[field(index = true, condition = "consumed_at IS NULL")]
#[rel(foreign_key, related_name = "tokens", db_index = false)]
user: ForeignKeyField<User>,
```

Set `db_index = false` when replacing a relationship's default full index with
a partial index.

## `#[admin(model, ...)]` Form Customization

`#[admin(model, ...)]` configures registered model fields only. It does not
create virtual fields or a separate form ordering mechanism: use `fields` or
`fieldsets` for inclusion and order.

The complete form-customization grammar is:

```rust,no_run
use reinhardt::admin::AdminForm;
use reinhardt::{admin, model};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[model(app_label = "blog", table_name = "articles")]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Article {
    #[field(primary_key = true)]
    id: i64,
    #[field(max_length = 255)]
    title: String,
    #[field(max_length = 255)]
    body: String,
    #[field(max_length = 255)]
    status: String,
    #[field(max_length = 255)]
    category: String,
    #[field(max_length = 255)]
    slug: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Default)]
struct ArticleForm;

impl AdminForm for ArticleForm {}

#[admin(model,
    for = Article,
    name = "Article",
    form = ArticleForm,
    formfield_overrides = [
        (body, widget = textarea, rows = 8),
        (status, widget = select, choices = [
            ("draft", "Draft"),
            ("published", "Published"),
        ]),
        (title, label = "Headline", help_text = "Shown above the article", placeholder = "A clear title", required = true),
    ],
    prepopulated_fields = [
        (slug, sources = [title, category]),
    ],
)]
struct ArticleAdmin;
```

`form` names a type implementing `AdminForm + Default + 'static`. The generated
admin uses a single lazily initialized default instance. Its `normalize` and
`validate` hooks are synchronous and pure; `normalize` receives owned JSON data
and `validate` borrows the normalized data. Field errors become HTTP 422 field entries and global errors
become `_all` entries.

Each `formfield_overrides` entry begins with a registered field identifier and
may set `widget`, `label`, `help_text`, `placeholder`, and `required`. Widget
values are `text_input`, `email_input`, `number_input`, `checkbox`,
`date_input`, `datetime_input`, `textarea`, `select`, `multiselect`,
`autocomplete`, `raw_id`, `many_to_many`, `file_input`, and `hidden_input`.
The shorthand aliases `text`, `email`, `number`, `date`, `datetime`,
`multi_select`, `file`, and `hidden` are also accepted.
`rows` is valid only with `textarea`; `choices` is valid only with `select` or
`multiselect`. Overrides merge property-wise after inferred and configured
relation widgets; `AdminForm::schema()` merges last. Requiredness may be
strengthened, never weakened, and readonly, nullability, relation authorization,
and save-time relation validation remain mandatory.

Each `prepopulated_fields` entry has `(target, sources = [source, ...])`.
Targets and sources must be registered resolved-form fields. Targets must be
editable text fields; sources cannot be file, foreign-key, or many-to-many
fields. Targets and sources must be unique where required by configuration and
cannot form cycles. Prepopulation is client-side, sticky per mount, and never
recomputed by the server. A non-empty edit target remains locked, and editing
or clearing a target prevents future automatic replacement during that mount.

Foreign-key and many-to-many fields accept only compatible relation widgets and
retain existing permission-aware lookup and save-time validation. The macro does
not support arbitrary components or attributes, asynchronous validation, virtual
fields, configurable transliteration, or server-side prepopulation.

Configured textarea rows use additive `TextAreaWithRows` variants in the public
field and rendering specifications. Exhaustive downstream matches must handle
those variants; the legacy unit `TextArea` variants and JSON wire shapes remain
available.

### MU-4 (SHOULD): Use Info Companion Type for Cross-Layer Data Transfer

The `#[model]` macro automatically generates a `{Model}Info` companion struct — a plain data carrier with model data fields, lightweight relationship fields, `pub` visibility, and bidirectional `From` conversions.

**Generated for every model by default.** Opt out of only the companion struct
with `#[model(info = false)]`. Use `#[model(server_only)]` for models that
must not expose shared `InfoModel` / `{Model}Info` output on WASM.

```rust
#[model(app_label = "blog", table_name = "posts")]
struct Post {
    #[field(primary_key = true)]
    id: Option<i64>,
    #[field(max_length = 255)]
    title: String,
    #[field(skip_info = true)]
    internal_cache: String,
    #[rel(foreign_key, related_name = "posts")]
    author: ForeignKeyField<Author>,
}

// Auto-generated:
// PostInfo {
//     id,
//     title,
//     author: RelationInfo<Author>,
// }
// From<Post> for PostInfo ✓
// From<PostInfo> for Post ✓
```

**Field inclusion rules:**
- Regular data fields: included
- `ForeignKeyField<T>` and `OneToOneField<T>`: included as `RelationInfo<T>`
- `ManyToManyField<Source, Target>`: included as `ManyToManyInfo<Source, Target>`
- FK `_id` fields (auto-generated): not exposed directly; use `info.author.id`
- Generated FK/OneToOne `*_id()` accessors return the related primary-key value, so shared native/WASM model code can use the same method call.
- Relationship marker types are not exposed directly because they do not carry values
- `#[field(skip = true)]` or `#[field(skip_info = true)]` fields: excluded;
  `#[field(skip_getter = true)]` only suppresses accessor and setter generation
- For a struct combining `#[user]` with `#[model]`, the mapped password-hash
  field is automatically excluded on native and WASM targets. Converting the
  generated `{User}Info` back into the model defaults that field, so an
  explicit `#[field(skip_info = true)]` annotation is unnecessary.

**Builder with relationship payload support:**
```rust
let info = PostInfo::build()
    .id(Some(1))
    .title("Hello")
    .author(&author)  // accepts &Author via IntoPrimaryKey
    .finish();

let info = PostInfo::build()
    .id(Some(1))
    .title("Hello")
    .author(author_uuid)  // also accepts raw PK value
    .finish();
```

Many-to-many Info fields use a lightweight target-primary-key list:

```rust
let info = PostInfo::build()
    .id(Some(1))
    .title("Hello")
    .author(author_uuid)
    .tags([tag_id_1, tag_id_2])
    .finish();

assert_eq!(info.author.id, author_uuid);
assert_eq!(info.tags.target_ids, vec![tag_id_1, tag_id_2]);
```

When serde derives are mirrored onto `{Model}Info`, the relationship payloads
serialize with the same lightweight field names:

```json
{
  "author": { "id": "..." },
  "tags": { "target_ids": ["..."] }
}
```

**Validation auto-generation:**
Validation attributes are derived from `#[field(...)]` config and emitted as `#[cfg_attr(native, validate(...))]`:

| `#[field(...)]` | Generated validation |
|---|---|
| `max_length = N` | `validate(length(max = N))` |
| `min_length = M` | `validate(length(min = M))` |
| `email = true` | `validate(email)` |
| `url = true` | `validate(url)` |
| `min_value = M` / `max_value = N` | `validate(range(min = M, max = N))` |

## `form!` Macro

### MU-5 (MUST): Keep Stable Native Widget Coverage Explicit

The `form!` DSL exposes the following native HTML coverage as stable API:

| DSL item | HTML output | Value state |
|---|---|---|
| `MonthInput` | `<input type="month">` | string field |
| `WeekInput` | `<input type="week">` | string field |
| `ResetButton` | `<button type="reset">` | none |
| `Button` | `<button type="button">` | none |
| `ImageInput` | `<input type="image">` | none |
| `Datalist` | `<datalist>` | option source only |
| `OptGroup` | `<optgroup>` | choice grouping only |
| `Output` | `<output>` | none |
| `Meter` | `<meter>` | none |
| `Progress` | `<progress>` | none |

`Datalist` is an option source for compatible inputs, not a value-holding
field. `OptGroup` groups choices inside choice controls and does not introduce
a separate value slot.

`MonthInput` and `WeekInput` are accepted only for raw string fields:
`CharField`, `TextField`, `EmailField`, `UrlField`, `SlugField`, and
`PasswordField`.

### MU-6 (MUST): Validate Typed Native Attributes Against Compatible Controls

Typed native attributes are valid only on controls that support the corresponding
HTML behavior:

| Attribute | Compatible controls |
|---|---|
| `min` / `max` / `step` | number, range, date, time, datetime-local, month, week |
| `size` | text-like inputs |
| `accept` / `capture` | file-like inputs |
| `list` | datalist-compatible text-like inputs |

`multiple` is not accepted as a typed field property yet. Use the
`SelectMultiple` widget for multi-select fields. File-like multi-select remains
deferred until the generated value contract can represent `Vec<File>` instead
of a single `Option<File>`.

### MU-7 (MUST): Treat `CustomWidget` as Experimental

`CustomWidget` is an experimental extension point. Call sites must opt in with
the `experimental` marker and provide an adapter:

```rust,ignore
date_range: CharField {
    widget: CustomWidget(crate::widgets::DateRangePicker) {
        experimental,
        adapter: crate::widgets::DateRangeAdapter,
    },
}
```

The adapter API may change in a minor release with a documented migration path.

### MU-8 (MUST): Render `FieldGroup` as a Semantic Fieldset

`FieldGroup` renders as semantic `<fieldset>` output. When `label` is present,
the label is rendered as a `<legend>` inside the fieldset.

---

### ✅ MUST DO
- Declare `app_label` explicitly on every model
- Initialize `#[model(...)]` structs via the macro-generated `build()` builder or zero-argument `new()` alias
- Add unrelated derives (e.g., `Debug`, `Clone`) via a separate `#[derive(...)]`
- Keep stable `form!` widget coverage aligned with the documented native HTML output and value state
- Validate typed native form attributes against the compatible control families
- Treat `CustomWidget` as experimental and require the explicit adapter syntax
- Render `FieldGroup` as semantic `<fieldset>` output with `label` mapped to `<legend>`

### ✅ SHOULD DO
- Omit `table_name` when the singular snake_case convention is the intended database name; keep it explicit for existing schemas
- Use `#[model(...)]` alone (do not also write `#[derive(Model)]`) — the attribute applies the derive for you
- Prefer `Model::build()` over the zero-argument `Model::new()` alias in tutorials, examples, and call sites where the model schema is expected to evolve (MU-3)
- Pass FK values via `.<related>(&model)` in `build()` setters when the related instance is already in scope (composes with #4398)
- Use `{Model}Info` for API DTOs and cross-layer data transfer instead of hand-writing parallel structs (MU-4)
- Use `#[field(skip_getter = true)]` to suppress a field's accessor and setter,
  or `#[field(skip_info = true)]` to exclude it from Info; `#[user]`
  automatically excludes its mapped password-hash field
- Use `#[model(info = false)]` only when the Info struct would be genuinely unused, but the model may still be referenced by shared relationship metadata
- Use `#[model(server_only)]` only for models that are intentionally native-only and should not participate in WASM/shared type contracts

### ❌ NEVER DO
- Initialize `#[model(...)]` structs via struct-literal syntax in production code (use `build()` or zero-argument `new()`)
