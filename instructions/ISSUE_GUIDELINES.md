# Issue Guidelines

## Purpose

This file defines the issue policy for the Reinhardt project. These rules ensure clear issue tracking, proper labeling, and consistent issue management.

---

## Language Requirements

### LR-1 (MUST): English-Only Content

**ALL issue titles, descriptions, and comments MUST be written in English.**

- Issue titles MUST be in English
- Issue descriptions MUST be in English
- All comments within issues MUST be in English
- Code examples and error messages may use their original language

**Rationale:** English ensures accessibility for all contributors and maintainers worldwide.

---

## Issue Creation Policy

### IC-1 (MUST): Use GitHub Tools

Issues MUST be created using:
- GitHub Web Interface
- GitHub CLI (`gh issue create`)
- GitHub MCP server

**Example (GitHub CLI):**
```bash
gh issue create --title "Bug: Connection pool leak" --body "Description..."
```

### IC-2 (MUST): Search Before Creating

**ALWAYS** search existing issues before creating a new one:
1. Search open and closed issues
2. Check if the issue has already been reported
3. Review related issues for context

**Example:**
```bash
gh issue list --search "connection pool"
gh issue list --state closed --search "leak"
```

### IC-3 (MUST): Use Issue Templates

Issues MUST be created using the appropriate issue template:
- Bug Report (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/1-bug_report.yml`)
- Feature Request (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/2-feature_request.yml`)
- Documentation (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/3-documentation.yml`)
- Question (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/4-question.yml`)
- Performance Issue (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/5-performance.yml`)
- CI/CD Issue (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/6-ci_cd.yml`)
- Security Vulnerability (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/7-security.yml`)
- API Change Proposal (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/8-api_change.yml`)

**Template Selection:**
| Issue Type | Template File | Label Applied |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Bug report | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/1-bug_report.yml` | `bug` |
| Feature request | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/2-feature_request.yml` | `enhancement` |
| Documentation | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/3-documentation.yml` | `documentation` |
| Question | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/4-question.yml` | `question` |
| Performance | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/5-performance.yml` | `performance` |
| CI/CD | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/6-ci_cd.yml` | `ci-cd` |
| Security | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/7-security.yml` | `security`, `critical` |
| API change proposal | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/8-api_change.yml` | `enhancement`, `rc-migration` |

**CLI Template Usage:**

When creating issues via `gh issue create`, GitHub CLI does not automatically apply templates like the Web UI. Read the appropriate template file from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and include its structure in your `--body` content.

**Note:** For security vulnerabilities, ALWAYS use GitHub Security Advisories instead of public issues.

---

## Issue Title Format

### IT-1 (MUST): Clear and Descriptive

Issue titles MUST be:
- **Specific**: Clearly describe the problem or request
- **Concise**: Maximum 72 characters for readability
- **Uppercase Start**: Begin with uppercase letter
- **Professional**: Use technical language

**Format Options:**

**Option 1: Type Prefix (Recommended)**
```
[Type]: <brief description>
```

**Option 2: Plain Descriptive**
```
<Brief descriptive title>
```

**Examples:**

| Type | Example Title |
|------|---------------|
| Bug | `Bug: Connection pool leak when using async transactions` |
| Feature | `Feature: Add MySQL database backend support` |
| Performance | `Performance: Slow query execution with large datasets` |
| Documentation | `Docs: Missing migration guide for v0.2.0` |
| CI/CD | `CI: TestContainers integration tests failing on macOS` |
| Security | `Security: SQL injection in user query builder` |
| Question | `Question: How to configure custom connection pool size?` |

**Title Quality:**

- ❌ Bad: "Fix bug" (too vague)
- ❌ Bad: "performance issue" (unclear what)
- ❌ Bad: "add feature" (which feature?)
- ✅ Good: "Bug: Connection pool leak when using async transactions"
- ✅ Good: "Performance: Query execution time increases linearly with dataset size"
- ✅ Good: "Feature: Support for MySQL 8.0 window functions"

**Label Combinations:**
- Minimum: One type label (`bug`, `enhancement`, etc.)
- Recommended: Type + Priority + Scope
- Example: `bug`, `high`, `database` for a critical database bug

| Triaged | Reviewed and labeled | Type + Priority + Scope |
| In Progress | Being actively worked | Add `in-progress` via project board |
| Blocked | Awaiting dependency | Add `blocked` via project board |
| Closed | Resolved | - |

### LC-2 (MUST): Issue Hygiene

**Issue Closure:**

- **Fixed**: Close with comment describing fix and referencing PR/commit
- **Duplicate**: Close with reference to original issue
- **Wontfix**: Close with explanation of why it won't be fixed
- **Invalid**: Close with explanation

**Comment Requirements:**
- Provide context for status changes
- Reference related issues or PRs
- Explain closure reasoning

**Stale Issues:**
- Issues inactive for 90 days marked as stale

Via GitHub Security Advisories (Recommended):
```
https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/security/advisories
```

**What to Include:**
- Vulnerability description
- Affected versions
- Steps to reproduce
- Proof of concept (if applicable)
- Impact assessment
- Proposed mitigation

**Response Timeline:**
- **48 hours**: Initial confirmation and acknowledgment
- **7 days**: Assessment and severity classification

- **90 days**: Coordinated disclosure timeline

**After Disclosure:**
- Issue will be created as PRIVATE
- Applied labels: `security`, `critical` (automatically)
- Maintainers will work on patch privately
- Public disclosure after fix is released
