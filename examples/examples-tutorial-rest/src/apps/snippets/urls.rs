//! URL configuration for the snippets app.
//!
//! This file is the canonical aggregator for the `snippets` app — it
//! exposes a single `url_patterns()` entry point that `src/config/urls.rs`
//! mounts under `/api/`. The `#[url_patterns(InstalledApp::snippets, mode = server)]`
//! attribute lives here so the routes macro can find the generated
//! `url_resolvers` module at the canonical path
//! `crate::apps::snippets::urls::url_resolvers`.
//!
//! `url_patterns()` registers the function-based endpoints (Tutorial 1-5)
//! and the ViewSet endpoints (Tutorial 6) on the same router — there is
//! no `USE_VIEWSET`-style toggle. Bruno (and `curl`, `httpie`, the
//! integration tests, …) can therefore drive either path against the
//! same running server.
//!
//! This app is REST-only — it has no client (WASM SPA) or WebSocket
//! surface, so the routes macro is invoked in
//! `examples/examples-tutorial-rest/src/config/urls.rs` with
//! `#[routes(server_only)]` (Issue #4509) and the per-app
//! `client_url_resolvers` / `ws_url_resolvers` module lookups are
//! skipped. No stub modules are required.
//!
//! ### Why the routes are inlined here instead of being aggregated from
//! ### per-style submodules
//!
//! An earlier draft split the function-based endpoints into
//! `urls/function_urls.rs` and the ViewSet into `urls/viewset_urls.rs`,
//! and tried to combine them via
//! `ServerRouter::new().mount("/", function_urls::function_url_patterns())
//!  .mount("/", viewset_urls::viewset_url_patterns())`. That requires each
//! helper to have its own `#[url_patterns(InstalledApp::snippets, mode = server)]`
//! attribute (otherwise the macro's `build_mount_reexport` cannot find a
//! sibling `url_resolvers` module on the mount target). Adding the
//! attribute to multiple sibling functions makes both modules emit a
//! `__for_each_url_resolver` macro of the same name, and the
//! aggregator's macro then fails with `error[E0659]: __for_each_url_resolver`
//! is ambiguous`. The framework currently supports at most one
//! `#[url_patterns(..., mode = server)]` per app, so we keep the macro
//! here and inline the endpoint/viewset registrations.
