# Cargo configuration for examples workspace
#
# This configuration enables local development mode when REINHARDT_LOCAL_DEV=1
# is set in the environment.

# When REINHARDT_LOCAL_DEV=1, use local workspace crates instead of crates.io
# This is configured via patch section below

# Note: To enable local development mode:
# export REINHARDT_LOCAL_DEV=1
# cargo build
