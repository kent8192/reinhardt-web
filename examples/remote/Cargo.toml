# Note: examples-* directories are intentionally NOT workspace members
# to avoid dependency resolution conflicts when reinhardt is not on crates.io.
# Each example should be built independently from its own directory.

# Note: Each example has a binary named "manage"
# This is intentional - examples are meant to be run individually:
#   cd examples-hello-world && cargo run
#   cd examples-rest-api && cargo run
#   cd examples-database-integration && cargo run
#
# Examples are not workspace members - build them individually from their directories

# Remote mode: Uses crates.io published versions
# Do not include [patch.crates-io] - use published reinhardt crates only
