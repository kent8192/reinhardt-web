//! # reinhardt-storages
//!
//! Cloud storage backend abstraction for the Reinhardt framework.
//!
//! This crate provides a unified interface for interacting with multiple cloud storage
//! providers (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) and local file system.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Unified API**: Single `StorageBackend` trait for all storage providers
//! - **Settings-first configuration**: `StorageSettings` composes with the
//!   Reinhardt `#[settings]` macro
//! - **Named storage registry**: file fields can resolve validated named
//!   backends with scoped process-wide activation
//! - **Collision-safe uploads**: portable normalized keys use atomic exclusive
//!   creation and bounded random suffix retries
//! - **Async I/O**: All operations are asynchronous using Tokio
//! - **Feature Flags**: Enable only the backends you need
//! - **Temporary URLs**: Generate S3 presigned URLs, GCS V4 signed URLs, and
//!   Azure SAS URLs for secure file sharing
//! - **Provider boundary**: S3 uses `reinhardt-providers` for minimal HTTP and
//!   SigV4 support instead of depending on the full AWS SDK
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use reinhardt_storages::{StorageSettings, create_storage_from_settings};
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let settings: StorageSettings = toml::from_str(r#"
//! backend = "local"
//!
//! [local]
//! base_path = "media"
//! "#)?;
//!
//!     let storage = create_storage_from_settings(&settings).await?;
//!     storage.save("example.txt", b"Hello, world!").await?;
//!     let content = storage.open("example.txt").await?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Storage settings contract
//!
//! The original `[storage]` entry is the `default` storage alias. It remains
//! valid when named entries are added. Each named entry has its own backend and
//! URL expiry; an omitted `url_expiry_secs` uses the 3,600-second default. The
//! named map is deliberately one level deep, so a named backend cannot contain
//! another `named` map. S3 and GCS URL expiry are validated at registry
//! initialization and cannot exceed their providers' seven-day signing limits.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [storage]
//! backend = "local"
//! url_expiry_secs = 3600
//!
//! [storage.local]
//! base_path = "media"
//!
//! [storage.named.private_uploads]
//! backend = "local"
//! url_expiry_secs = 900
//!
//! [storage.named.private_uploads.local]
//! base_path = "private-media"
//! ```
//!
//! A file-field alias must resolve to a backend that advertises atomic
//! exclusive creation (`StorageCapabilities::exclusive_create`). The upload
//! service calls `StorageBackend::save_if_absent`; `save` remains the explicit
//! overwrite operation. The local, S3, GCS, and Azure implementations provide
//! this capability. Application startup should validate every alias before
//! activating the registry, so a missing alias or non-exclusive backend fails
//! before an upload can begin.
//!
//! Select one provider feature for an application build. For example, a local
//! deployment can use `default-features = false, features = ["local"]`, while
//! an S3 deployment can use `default-features = false, features = ["s3"]`.
//! The `all` feature is intended for compatibility or provider-matrix tests,
//! not as an application default. A settings entry still selects exactly one
//! backend through its `backend` value.
//!
//! ## Storage-backed model fields
//!
//! `reinhardt-db` exposes typed `FileField` and `ImageField` values with
//! generated model descriptors. The application facade initializes this
//! crate's registry before model operations and holds the returned
//! `ActiveStorageRegistryGuard` for the lifetime of the application.
//!
//! Descriptor lifecycle methods coordinate storage with one caller-owned
//! database closure. New objects remain under an RAII compensation guard from
//! backend creation through database commit: validation, storage, database
//! failure, or cancellation removes them best-effort while preserving the
//! primary error. After database success, replacement, clear, and row-delete
//! cleanup of old committed objects is best-effort; cleanup failures are logged
//! and do not change the committed database result.
//!
//! `ImageField` accepts supported raster formats only, requires the filename
//! extension to match the decoded format, rejects corrupt and SVG uploads, and
//! enforces inclusive configured dimension limits without transforming the
//! original bytes. The lower-level [`store_uploaded_file`] function remains an
//! eager single-object primitive: it does not coordinate a database closure,
//! compensate later failures, clean old objects, or perform image validation.
//!
//! ## Compatibility
//!
//! `StorageConfig` and provider-specific `XxxConfig` structs are deprecated.
//! Use `StorageSettings` with `create_storage_from_settings()` for new code.
