Stable release of `reinhardt-storages` for the Reinhardt 0.2.0 line. This
entry consolidates the 0.2.0 release-candidate series into one
stable release section.

### Migration Notes

- Treat `StorageError` as non-exhaustive and keep wildcard match arms in
  downstream code.
- Move storage configuration to the settings-first `StorageSettings` surface.
- Use the wiremock-backed S3 test setup instead of LocalStack-only assumptions.
- See [`instructions/MIGRATION_0.2.md`](../../instructions/MIGRATION_0.2.md) for the workspace migration checklist.
