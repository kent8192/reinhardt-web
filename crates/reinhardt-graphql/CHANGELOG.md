## [0.3.17](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/compare/reinhardt-graphql@v0.3.16...reinhardt-graphql@v0.3.17) - 2026-09-13

### Documentation

- *(security)* document the 0.3.17 GraphQL compatibility exception

### Fixed

- fix!(graphql): validate operations after request preparation

### Security

- *(graphql)* enforce gRPC operation classes

### Testing

- *(graphql)* initialize DI fixture registrations once

### Security

- [**breaking**] **0.3.17 security exception:** Enforce gRPC operation classes
  on the final document after schema extensions prepare and parse the request.
  Build custom schemas with `GraphQLGrpcService::schema_builder` before calling
  `GraphQLGrpcService::new`, which now panics for unguarded schemas. Invalid
  subscription requests report stream status errors before resolver creation.
  See the [0.3.17 migration guide](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/instructions/MIGRATION_0.3.17.md)
  for the required changes and the scope of this patch compatibility exception.

Stable release of `reinhardt-graphql` for the Reinhardt 0.2.0 line. This
entry consolidates the 0.2.0 release-candidate series into one
stable release section.

### Migration Notes

- Review the breaking changes listed below before upgrading from 0.1.x.
- See the root CHANGELOG and `instructions/MIGRATION_0.2.md` for cross-crate migration guidance.

### Changed

- [**breaking**] align develop/0.2.0 with main, preserving 8 feature crates

### Fixed

- *(ci)* recover develop release-plz prerelease

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/compare/reinhardt-graphql@v0.1.0-rc.30...reinhardt-graphql@v0.1.0) - 2026-05-22

Initial stable release of `reinhardt-graphql` as part of the
reinhardt-web 0.1.0 release. Wires an async-graphql-based server into
reinhardt-web's routing, dependency injection, and per-request scope
model.

For the workspace-wide release narrative, see the [root CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22).
Per-prerelease history is in the [Release Discussions](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/categories/release).

### Capabilities at 0.1.0

- **GraphQL handlers with DI** — handler macros fork the
  `InjectionContext` per request, so resolvers can declare
  `Depends<T>` parameters and obtain request-scoped services without
  smuggling state through `async_graphql::Context`.
- **Query complexity & depth limits** — `QueryLimits` enforces field
  counts (with inline-fragment and block-string awareness),
  validates names by Unicode scalar count, and exits counting paths
  early on multi-byte input.
- **Subscription backpressure** — subscriptions propagate stream
  errors to GraphQL clients instead of silently dropping them, and
  carry backpressure on subscription channels.
- **Resilient runtime locks** — `RwLock` use was migrated off raw
  `unwrap()` to a poison-recovery pattern centralised in a logging
  helper, so a single panicked task no longer poisons the server.
- **Reinhardt facade re-exports** — base async-graphql types are
  re-exported through the reinhardt facade, so user crates can take
  a single workspace dependency.
- **UUID v7 by default** — generated identifiers in graphql-touching
  paths follow the workspace-wide migration to UUID v7 (with v4
  retained for security-sensitive tokens).

### Notable Breaking Changes

- **`Injected<T>` deprecated** ([#3631](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3631))
  — resolver injection sites move to `Depends<T>` and lose the
  implicit `Clone` bound.

### Migration Notes

See the [root CHANGELOG migration guide](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#migration-guide)
for the DI changes. GraphQL-specific resolvers require no further
rewrite: existing async-graphql schemas continue to work; only
`Injected<T>` → `Depends<T>` at resolver entry points needs to
be applied.
