## [0.1.0](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/compare/reinhardt-testkit-macros@v0.1.0-rc.30...reinhardt-testkit-macros@v0.1.0) - 2026-05-22

Initial stable release of `reinhardt-testkit-macros` as part of the
reinhardt-web 0.1.0 release. `reinhardt-testkit-macros` provides the
`with_di_overrides!` procedural macro that powers ergonomic DI
mocking in `reinhardt-testkit` tests.

For the workspace-wide release narrative (Highlights, Breaking
Changes, Migration Guide), see the [root CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22).
Per-prerelease history is preserved in the
[Release Discussions](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/categories/release).

### Capabilities at 0.1.0

- **`with_di_overrides!` macro** — One-line DI mocking inside a test:
  the macro expands to a `DiOverrideBuilder` chain that registers
  the requested overrides and yields a scoped `InjectionContext`
  ready to drive a handler or service.
- **Generated paths routed through `reinhardt-testkit`** — The
  macro emits fully-qualified paths that resolve through the
  `reinhardt-testkit` facade, so downstream tests do not have to
  add `reinhardt-testkit-macros` to their dependency list directly
  (it is re-exported).
- **Stable proc-macro toolchain** — Pinned to workspace `syn` /
  `quote` / `proc-macro2` versions with `trybuild` and `rstest`
  coverage; KI-2-compliant `[dev-dependencies]` (path-only
  `reinhardt-testkit`) so publish ordering remains correct.

### Notable Breaking Changes

This release does not introduce crate-level breaking changes.

### Migration Notes

This is the first stable release of the macro and no migration is
required from prerelease versions; the macro signature has been
stable since `0.1.0-rc.16`.
