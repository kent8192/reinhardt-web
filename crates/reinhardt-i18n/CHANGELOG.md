## [0.1.0](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/compare/reinhardt-i18n@v0.1.0-rc.30...reinhardt-i18n@v0.1.0) - 2026-05-22

Initial stable release of `reinhardt-i18n` as part of the reinhardt-web
0.1.0 release. Provides locale activation, message catalog loading, and
plural-aware translation for Django-style i18n in Rust.

For the workspace-wide release narrative, see the [root CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22).
Per-prerelease history is in the [Release Discussions](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/categories/release).

### Capabilities at 0.1.0

- **Locale activation guards** — `TranslationGuard` activates a locale
  for the current task and restores the prior locale on drop, using
  `try_borrow_mut` so the destructor cannot panic re-entrantly.
- **Gettext-compatible PO parser** — Reads PO files with full
  `msgctxt` continuation-line support, enforces input-size limits, and
  refuses path traversal in `CatalogLoader::load` so untrusted locale
  directories cannot escape the catalog root.
- **Comprehensive plural rules** — Plural-form expressions cover the
  Unicode CLDR rule families (including the corrected non-plural
  language set without Hungarian) and validate plural indices to
  prevent memory exhaustion.
- **Locale and format validation** — `validate_locale()` is applied
  uniformly across every entry point, with a length cap; number and
  format-string handling rejects malformed inputs and special float
  values rather than panicking.
- **Optional DI integration** — Activated via the `di` feature, the
  crate registers translation services with `reinhardt-di` so message
  loaders can be injected via `Depends<T>`.

### Notable Breaking Changes

`reinhardt-i18n` did not introduce its own framework-wide breaking
changes in 0.1.0. Workspace-level breaking changes are tracked at the
[Breaking Changes Discussions](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/categories/breaking-changes)
and summarized in the [root CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22).

### Migration Notes

See the workspace-level [Migration Guide](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22)
for the full upgrade flow. Crate-specific notes:

- DI integration moved to `Depends<T>` ([#3628](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3628));
  update injection sites from `Arc<T>` accordingly.
- Eight previously unused dependencies were dropped from `Cargo.toml`;
  if you transitively depended on them through this crate, declare
  them directly.
