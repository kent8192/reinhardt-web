## [0.1.0](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/compare/reinhardt-http@v0.1.0-rc.30...reinhardt-http@v0.1.0) - 2026-05-22

Initial stable release of `reinhardt-http` as part of the reinhardt-web
0.1.0 release. Provides the foundational HTTP request and response
abstractions, the middleware-chain plumbing, and the sanitization /
input-validation helpers used by every higher layer in the framework.

For the workspace-wide release narrative, see the [root CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22).

### Capabilities at 0.1.0

- **Typed `Request` / `Response` builders** — Owning request and
  response types with ergonomic header accessors (`append_header` for
  multi-value `Set-Cookie`, `with_header_if_absent` /
  `try_with_header_if_absent`), `query_as<T>()` for type-safe query
  deserialization, and `extract_bearer_token()` / `get_client_ip()` /
  `validate_content_type()` helpers migrated from `reinhardt-micro` for
  a single API surface.
- **Middleware chain with DI contribution** — `Middleware` trait
  exposes a `di_registrations` hook plus type-erased DI APIs so that
  middleware (sessions, auth, etc.) can register its own services into
  the request-scoped container, and `ExcludeMiddleware` provides
  declarative route exclusion. Errors raised inside the chain are
  converted to responses uniformly rather than panicking.
- **Sanitization and input-validation suite** — `validate_html_attr_name`,
  `is_safe_url` (with anchor-link support), path-traversal prevention,
  XSS escaping, `SafeErrorResponse` to prevent information leakage, and
  resource-limit configuration covering body size and upload paths.
- **Defensive runtime primitives** — Poison-recovery patterns replace
  every `Mutex::lock().unwrap()`, `char_indices`-based truncation
  preserves UTF-8 in log messages, and chunked uploads carry session
  timeouts. Uploaded files use cryptographically random filenames.
- **Cross-cutting integration points** — Per-request `InjectionContext`
  is installed on the HTTP request so `use_inject` resolves the active
  context; `AuthState::from_extensions()` discovers auth state
  directly from request extensions for downstream middleware.

### Notable Breaking Changes

This crate's public API was stabilized incrementally across the alpha
and rc lifecycle; the workspace-wide breaking changes are catalogued
in the [root CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22)
and in the [Breaking Changes Discussions](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/categories/breaking-changes).

### Migration Notes

This is the first stable release, so there is no prior stable version
to migrate from. See the [root CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22)
for the cross-crate migration guide.
