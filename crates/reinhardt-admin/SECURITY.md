# reinhardt-admin Security Policy

## System and Scope

This policy inherits the repository [Security Policy](../../SECURITY.md) and
the framework-crate [Security Policy](../SECURITY.md). Policies compose from
the repository root to this crate; this closest policy wins on conflict.

`reinhardt-admin` serves a privileged administrative UI and its server
functions, generated clients, static assets, import/export facilities, and
WASM SPA. Admin routes, form values, record identifiers, files, and browser
state are attacker-controlled until the server validates them.

## Security Invariants

- Every privileged read, mutation, bulk action, import, export, and custom
  action enforces server-side model and operation permission. Applications
  requiring object or tenant isolation provide it through
  `ModelAdmin::get_queryset`; detail, update, delete, and bulk-delete paths
  apply that query scope before accessing each record. Mutations retain the
  scoped row lock through the write transaction. Client, WASM, and
  generated-client state is display state only.
- Admin detail and list responses project row maps through the selected
  `ModelAdmin::fields` and `list_display` policy before serialization.
- List response row identifiers are carried separately in `object_ids` solely
  as routing metadata for authorized detail and mutation operations; they are
  never added to the projected row map unless explicitly listed.
  Exports require the same explicit field policy before returning records.
- Cookie-authenticated mutations preserve CSRF protection. Security-sensitive
  identifiers, ownership, tenant, role, permission, credential, and read-only
  fields cannot be changed through forms, inline edits, or alternate requests
  unless the server explicitly authorizes that operation.
- Import and export validate formats and data, bound work, preserve the
  caller's authorized scope, and must neutralize spreadsheet formula prefixes
  before CSV/TSV values are opened by spreadsheet software. Protected
  applications must also apply the selected `ModelAdmin` field allowlist,
  read-only, ownership, and tenant checks to every imported record. The
  server-function import path applies the same create-field validation and
  sanitization to each record before insertion. It deserializes its complete
  request body before calling `import_data`, so its file-size check does not
  bound request-body buffering or JSON parsing; callers must enforce a body
  limit before server-function deserialization. `CsvExporter` and `TsvExporter`
  forward cell text without formula neutralization; RFC 4180 quoting and TSV
  delimiter escaping alone do not prevent formula interpretation. Rendered
  values use context-appropriate escaping.
- Static, uploaded, generated, and vendor asset paths remain confined to their
  configured asset roots. Deployments enabling remote executable or render-
  active vendor assets must provide verified integrity values before download
  or serving; an empty integrity value is an explicitly unverified bootstrap,
  not a trusted update.
- Native, WASM, generated-client, and direct server-function paths enforce
  equivalent permissions and never let a client-side route or UI check replace
  server authorization.

## Reportable Findings

Report admin authorization or CSRF bypass, protected-field mass assignment,
unsafe import/export or rendered values, asset confinement escape, unverified
remote active vendor assets, or weaker native/WASM/generated-client behavior.
