## [0.1.0](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/compare/reinhardt-dentdelion@v0.1.0-rc.30...reinhardt-dentdelion@v0.1.0) - 2026-05-22

Initial stable release of `reinhardt-dentdelion` (Delion) as part of
the reinhardt-web 0.1.0 release. Provides the plugin system that
loads, sandboxes, and runs framework extensions — including a WASM
component runtime built on `wasmtime`.

For the workspace-wide release narrative, see the [root CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22).
Per-prerelease history is in the [Release Discussions](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/categories/release).

### Capabilities at 0.1.0

- **`Plugin` trait + manifest** — A first-class plugin contract with
  TOML manifest metadata, deterministic loading, and topologically
  sorted initialization, so plugins can declare dependencies on one
  another without ordering bugs.
- **WASM Component Model sandbox** — Behind the `wasm` feature, plugins
  run inside a `wasmtime` Component Model sandbox with a 128 MiB
  default memory limit, 30 s execution timeout, and per-plugin
  configuration. The models capability is intentionally excluded from
  WASM (compile-time integration only).
- **Defense-in-depth security controls** — Plugin names are validated
  against path-traversal and log-injection vectors, SSRF guards filter
  outbound URLs from WASM hosts, SQL queries from WASM plugins go
  through a `sqlparser` allowlist, and script-tag escaping in
  hydration blocks XSS in rendered output.
- **Optional JavaScript SSR** — The `ts` feature enables a pure-Rust
  `boa_engine` JavaScript runtime for React/Preact SSR, with
  `scraper`-based CSS/meta extraction for the rendered output.
- **`crates_io` integration** — The `cli` feature surfaces helpers for
  publishing and pulling Delion plugins from crates.io, with a proper
  User-Agent and `reqwest::Client` shared across `HostState`
  instances.

### Notable Breaking Changes

- **`ColumnType` and `TsError` are `#[non_exhaustive]`** — Match arms
  on these enums must include a wildcard fallback.

Workspace-level breaking changes are tracked at the
[Breaking Changes Discussions](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/categories/breaking-changes)
and summarized in the [root CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22).

### Migration Notes

See the workspace-level [Migration Guide](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2026-05-22)
for the full upgrade flow. Crate-specific notes:

- Add a `_ => …` fallback to existing `match` expressions on
  `ColumnType` and `TsError`.
- `wasmtime` is pinned at `36.0.6` for the lifetime of 0.1.x to clear
  the security advisories that motivated the downgrade; align your
  workspace overrides accordingly.
- The `unsafe impl Send/Sync for TsRuntime` was removed; if you held a
  `TsRuntime` across `.await` points, restructure to keep it
  task-local.
