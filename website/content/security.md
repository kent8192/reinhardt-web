# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

### Primary: GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)

[Report a vulnerability via GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/security/advisories/new)

This ensures your report is kept confidential until a fix is released.

### Email

For questions or if GitHub Advisories is unavailable:

**security@reinhardt-web.dev**

## Response Timeline

| Severity | Acknowledgment | Patch Target |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Critical | 48 hours | 30 days |
| High | 48 hours | 30 days |
| Medium | 7 days | 90 days |
| Low | 30 days | Best effort |

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release on crates.io receives security patches.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure:

1. You report the vulnerability privately
2. We acknowledge within 48 hours
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We release the fix and publish a security advisory
5. You may publicly disclose after the fix is released

## Credits

We publicly credit reporters in the security advisory unless anonymity is requested.

Thank you for helping keep Reinhardt secure.
