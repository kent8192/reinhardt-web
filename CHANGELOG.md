## [0.2.0](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/compare/reinhardt-web@v0.1.3...reinhardt-web@v0.2.0) - 2026-06-11

Stable 0.2.0 is the first release of the Reinhardt 0.2 line. It
promotes the `0.2.0-rc.2` through `0.2.0-rc.6` train into one upgrade
story: remove the 0.1.x compatibility layer, adopt the final Manouche
v2 page/form model, move application configuration to typed settings
fragments, and make routing, testing, and local development more
explicit.

This release is not a patch-style rollup. It is a migration release for
applications that stayed on 0.1.x while the 0.2 APIs stabilized. Earlier
RC entries below preserve the detailed history; final release-polish
changes are folded into this upgrade-oriented summary.

### Upgrade Impact

| Area | What changes for application maintainers |
|---|---|
| Pages and forms | Update `page!` bodies, hooks, `use_resource`, `use_form`, dynamic fields, and component invocation to the Manouche v2 contract. |
| Routing | Replace generated typed URL resolver surfaces with explicit named reverse lookups and app-local URL helpers. |
| Auth and DI | Move to application-owned `#[user]` models, `CurrentUser<U>`, `Depends<T>`, and final auth identity traits. |
| Settings | Replace ad-hoc `XxxConfig` / legacy settings APIs with composed `#[settings(fragment = true)]` structures. |
| ORM and migrations | Update filter calls, model builders, generated Info DTO usage, and migration review expectations. |
| Test support | Move server-function and auth tests to MSW-backed mocks, fluent auth helpers, and directory-backed migration fixtures. |

### Release Highlights

- **Manouche v2 becomes the stable page/form model.** `page!` now wraps
  expressions and control flow reactively, hooks use explicit dependency
  tuples, component invocation uses the brace syntax, `use_resource`
  replaces the split resource-hook surface, and `use_form` is driven by
  form definitions.
- **Routing is intentionally more explicit.** The old generated
  `ResolvedUrls` / resolver trait surface is removed in favor of
  fully-qualified route names, `reverse(...)`, and small app-local
  wrapper functions. Client route helpers collapse to arity-inferred
  `route_path`.
- **Settings fragments are the configuration contract.** Auth, tasks,
  server, gRPC, deeplink, websockets, middleware, mail, templates, and
  embedded settings nodes now compose through typed fragments. Secret
  fields accept environment and file-backed source maps.
- **ORM and migration APIs are stricter but easier to compose.**
  Query filters take one filter expression, Django-style lookup helpers
  and composite combinators are available, generated model builders can
  override macro-managed fields where needed, and reverse migration SQL
  can emit multiple backend-specific statements.
- **The browser and WASM testing surface is more realistic.** WASM
  server-function tests resolve endpoints against the browser document
  URL, the MSW harness matches reqwest's WASM backend behavior, SPA link
  rerendering and dynamic radio choices are fixed, and admin browser CRUD
  is wired through the tutorial app.
- **The local development loop is materially faster.** Hot reload now
  chooses the rebuild target from the changed files, static page edits
  can hot-patch without a full rebuild, browsers reload only after a
  successful rebuild, and build-loop benchmarks track cold, server,
  Pages WASM, and HMR paths.
- **Project scaffolding is closer to real projects.** `startproject`
  supports interactive Reinhardt version and feature selection,
  `reinhardt-admin configure` can update facade dependency settings, and
  `manage infra` can provision local PostgreSQL and Redis containers
  while keeping `.reinhardt/local-infra.json` out of generated projects.

### Breaking Changes

- **URL routing**: typed URL helper generation from `#[routes]`,
  `ResolvedUrls`, `url_prelude`, `UrlResolverUnprefixed`, flat route
  accessor traits, and numbered client route helpers are removed. Use
  explicit reverse lookups such as `reverse("server:app:name", params)`
  and app-local wrappers.
- **Pages and forms**: `page!` now wraps dynamic expressions reactively,
  rejects implicit outer captures, removes bare-identifier shorthand,
  and expects explicit dependency tuples for React-style hooks.
  `create_resource*` is superseded by `use_resource(fetcher, deps)`,
  and `use_form` is routed through form definitions.
- **Dependency injection**: `Injected<T>` and `OptionalInjected<T>` are
  removed in favor of `Depends<T>` and `Option<Depends<T>>`.
- **Authentication**: old `User`, `SimpleUser`, `AnonymousUser`,
  `DefaultUser`, and compatibility extractor shapes are removed. Use
  application-owned `#[user]` models, `AuthIdentity`, `BaseUser` /
  `FullUser`, `PermissionsMixin`, and `CurrentUser<U>`.
- **Configuration**: legacy `Settings`, `AdvancedSettings`,
  `JsonFileSource`, `auto_source`, and mutable interpolation APIs are
  removed in favor of composed settings structs and `TomlFileSource`.
- **Database/query**: filter APIs take a single filter expression,
  `SeaRc<T>` is replaced by `SharedRc<T>`, and reverse migration SQL may
  return multiple statements.
- **Testing**: old fetch/server-function mocks, built-in `TestUser`,
  `force_authenticate`, and global-registry migration fixtures are
  replaced by MSW-backed mocks, test-local users, fluent auth helpers,
  and directory-backed migration fixtures.
- **Storage**: `StorageError` is non-exhaustive; downstream matches need
  wildcard arms.

### Migration Guide

Follow [`instructions/MIGRATION_0.2.md`](instructions/MIGRATION_0.2.md)
as the canonical 0.1.x to 0.2.0 checklist. The safest order is: update
dependencies, remove deprecated API references, update ORM/query calls,
migrate touched config to settings fragments, regenerate and review
database migrations, then run the verification commands in the guide.

### Added

- Django-like ORM lookup helpers and composite filter combinators.
- Settings fragments and settings-first constructors across auth, tasks,
  server, gRPC, deeplink, websockets, middleware, mail, and templates.
- Manouche v2 component syntax, typed form field generics, `use_resource`,
  hook dependency tracking, and server-function metadata available across
  targets.
- Storage backends and test coverage for local, S3-compatible, GCS, and
  Azure-style storage flows.
- Interactive admin dependency configuration and refreshed project
  templates for 0.2.0 projects.
- Generated model-info companion types are exported for WASM targets so
  tutorial and admin-style flows can share the same model metadata.

### Changed

- URL routing now prefers explicit route names and reverse lookup over
  generated typed resolver surfaces.
- Auth extraction standardizes on `CurrentUser<U>` while keeping
  `AuthUser<U>` as a deprecated 0.2 compatibility wrapper.
- `Model::new()` and generated model builders align with the final 0.2
  model-construction contract.
- Formatter responsibilities are split out of the admin CLI and routed
  through the published `reinhardt-formatter` crate.
- Tutorial route contracts are aggregated or inlined where appropriate so
  the example apps match the final route and page-template structure.

### Deprecated

- Compatibility wrappers that still exist for the 0.2 cycle are retained
  only as migration aids and are documented for removal in a later train.
- Legacy config structs are deprecated where settings fragments provide
  the final contract.

### Fixed

- WASM and feature-boundary failures in pages, auth, urls, test support,
  and release fixtures.
- Form runtime parity, dynamic radio choices, SPA link rerendering, SSR
  hydration IDs, and reactive mount borrow handling.
- Admin formatter wiring, migration fixture preservation, and project
  template dependency wiring.
- Migration generation, model companion derives, query expectations, and
  backend-specific SQL behavior.
- Empty-form focus handling no longer emits unreachable focus paths.
- Project templates now include pages app reverse helpers, collectstatic
  no-input defaults, tutorial-safe model placeholders, and sqlite database
  ignores.
- Release-branch CI is stabilized against the aws-runtime event-stream
  signer issue and broken upstream transitive releases.

### Security

- Storage integration tests moved away from LocalStack-only assumptions
  and now use deterministic mock servers where appropriate.
- Auth permission tests no longer depend on minute-precision wall-clock
  boundaries.
- URL, redirect, CSRF, and HTML-safety primitives from the 0.1 line remain
  part of the stable security surface.

### Performance

- Hot reload skips unrelated rebuilds, reuses pages wasm artifacts when
  stale checks allow it, and notifies browsers after rebuilds.
- Generated page attributes are batched, unused runtime parser dependencies
  are pruned, and non-browser wasm modules are feature-gated out.
- Build-loop, pages wasm, server-loop, hot reload, and cold workspace
  measurements informed the final dev-profile defaults.

### Maintenance

- Release-plz handling for develop trains, branch naming, publish checks,
  stale generated release branches, and release announcements was hardened.
- Public API documentation coverage, docs.rs links, website channel routing,
  and release website deployment were aligned for stable publication.
- Release announcements and tutorial documentation were synchronized with
  route-contract, settings-fragment, typed-form, generated model-info, and
  pages-template guidance.
- Examples and generated templates were refreshed against the local 0.2.0
  workspace instead of published RC assumptions.
- Temporary vendored AWS runtime overrides were removed once the release
  train no longer needed them.

### Testing

- Release CI expectations, WASM fixtures, trybuild output, migration
  boundaries, HMR reload behavior, and auth clock-boundary tests were
  refreshed for the stable line.
- Tutorial basis CI now exercises the polling tests against the fixed
  runtime expectations.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/compare/reinhardt-web@v0.1.0-rc.30...reinhardt-web@v0.1.0) - 2026-05-22

First stable release of `reinhardt-web`, after 19 alpha and 30 rc
prereleases dating back to 2026-01-23. The entry below is a curated
feature-level summary; per-prerelease commit history is available in
the [Release-category Discussions](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/categories/release).

### Highlights

- **Type-safe, convention-driven framework**: reinhardt-web brings
  Django-like ergonomics to Rust with fully typed URL routing,
  dependency injection, and form validation that fail at compile time,
  not runtime.
- **Full-stack WASM SPA support**: build reactive client UIs with
  Server Functions that auto-serialize across the network boundary,
  complete with CSRF protection and pluggable JWT / session
  authentication.
- **Pragmatic admin interface**: the built-in admin panel supports
  role-based permissions, type-safe query filters, and integrated ORM
  operations without separate admin declarations — just `#[model]` and
  opt in.
- **Async-first, runtime-agnostic**: every public API is async by
  default and integrates cleanly with Tokio, with TestContainers-backed
  integration tests for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and CockroachDB.

### Breaking Changes

The list below names every breaking change introduced across the
alpha / rc lifecycle. Each entry links to its announcement in the
[Breaking Changes Discussions](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/categories/breaking-changes);
follow the **Migration Guide** below for the most disruptive moves.

- **Dependency injection unifies on `Depends<T>`** ([#3628](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3628)) — `#[inject]` no longer accepts `Arc<T>` directly; use `Depends<T>` so the framework can cache resolution, detect cycles, and surface DI metadata.
- **`Injected<T>` deprecated** ([#3631](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3631)) — replaced by `Depends<T>`; the auto-`Clone` bound is removed.
- **`#[url_patterns]` becomes typed** ([#3770](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3770)) — accepts `InstalledApp::*` identifiers with `mode = server|client|unified`; pattern functions are renamed accordingly.
- **`#[viewset]` macro and route mounting** ([#4476](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4476)) — per-app `server_fn` and client UI now live under `apps/<app>/`; `commands/templates/...` no longer carries handler code.
- **URL resolver directory layout** ([#3918](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3918)) — `ws_urls.rs` and friends move under `src/apps/<app>/urls/`.
- **`AdminUser` trait signature** ([#3615](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3615)) — `ModelAdmin` permission methods accept `&dyn AdminUser` instead of `&(dyn Any + Send + Sync)`.
- **`admin_routes_with_di()`** ([#3626](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3626)) — the new entry point applies middleware-contributed DI registrations; legacy `admin_routes()` is removed.
- **`AdminRoute` is `#[non_exhaustive]`** — match arms must include a default fallback; the `Login` variant moved position.
- **OAuth2 `exchange_code` redirect URI** ([#3609](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3609)) — fourth argument is the callback URL.
- **Typed TOML interpolation** ([#4241](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4241), [#4229](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4229)) — `${VAR}` placeholders in TOML coerce to the destination type; opt out with `SettingsBuilder::with_typed_coercion(false)`.
- **`ProjectSettings` replaces `env::var`** in commands/db ([#4295](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4295)) and `VersioningSettings` in rest ([#4294](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4294)).
- **`ClientLauncher::on_navigate`** ([#4117](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4117)) — SPA navigation routes through `Router::on_navigate` instead of relaunching the client per navigation.
- **`client_router::history` dedup** ([#4219](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4219)) — the duplicate `history` module under `client_router` is removed; consume `pages::router::history` instead.
- **`#[routes]` is async-capable** — route handler signatures may be `async fn`; sync handler ABIs remain supported but no longer represent the canonical shape.
- **`define_views!` → `flatten_imports!`** ([#3783](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3783)) — multi-file view modules use the renamed declarative macro; `#[export_endpoints]` is removed.
- **`JsonFileSource` / `auto_source` deprecated** ([#4120](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4120)) — prefer `TomlFileSource` (default interpolation enabled).
- **`#[user(...)]` requires explicit `LABEL`** on `AppLabel` implementors, and emits a `BaseUserManager` impl in 0.1.0.
- **`unique_together` propagates into `ModelMetadata`** ([#4027](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4027)) — autodetector consumes it; existing migrations regenerate.
- **Admin form widget HTML elements** ([#3771](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3771)) — `TextArea`, `Select`, and `MultiSelect` render as their semantic HTML elements rather than `<input>`.
- **`manouche` IR / IRVisitor removed** ([#3900](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3900)) — internal codegen path no longer exposes the IR layer.
- **`examples-rest` layout** ([#4476](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4476)) — `standalone` flag and `USE_VIEWSET` toggle dropped; `urls/` restructured for `ResolvedUrls`; Bruno collection split per ViewSet.
- **`infra/repository` reviewer lookup** ([#4152](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4152)) — Terraform module replaces the `data "github_user"` lookup with a numeric user-ID variable.

### Migration Guide

The 0.1.0 stable release consolidates the alpha line and the historical rc
snapshots. For migration purposes, users on any rc version should follow the
guide below as if migrating from pre-release code. Notable breaking changes
accumulated during stabilization are summarized below; the complete list is in
the **Breaking Changes** section above.

- **Typed URL routing** ([#3770](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3770)):
  replace string-based `#[url_patterns]` with
  `#[url_patterns(InstalledApp::app_name, mode = server|client|unified)]`
  and rename functions to `server_url_patterns()` /
  `client_url_patterns()` / `unified_url_patterns()`.
- **Dependency injection unification**
  ([#3628](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3628)):
  replace `#[inject] Arc<T>` with `#[inject] Depends<T>` across every
  injection site. `Depends<T>` adds caching, circular-dependency
  detection, and metadata that bare `Arc<T>` lacked.
- **Deprecate `Injected<T>`**
  ([#3631](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3631)):
  migrate `Injected<T>` and `OptionalInjected<T>` to `Depends<T>` and
  `Option<Depends<T>>`. Add an explicit `#[derive(Clone)]` if your type
  was relying on the previous auto-Clone behaviour.
- **`AdminUser` trait signature**
  ([#3615](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3615)):
  update `ModelAdmin` permission methods to accept `&dyn AdminUser`
  instead of `&(dyn std::any::Any + Send + Sync)`.
- **OAuth2 `exchange_code` redirect URI**
  ([#3609](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3609)):
  `exchange_code()` now requires a `redirect_uri` parameter; pass the
  callback URL as the fourth argument.
- **Typed TOML interpolation**
  ([#4241](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4241)):
  environment-variable interpolation in TOML (e.g.,
  `${REINHARDT_DB_PORT}`) now coerces to the target type. Opt out with
  `SettingsBuilder::with_typed_coercion(false)`.
- **URL resolver restructuring**
  ([#3918](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3918)):
  move `src/apps/<app>/ws_urls.rs` to `src/apps/<app>/urls/ws_urls.rs`
  and declare it in the `urls` submodule.
- **`define_views!` replaces `#[export_endpoints]`**
  ([#3768](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3768)):
  use the `define_views!` declarative macro for multi-file view
  modules — the attribute form was removed for stable-Rust
  compatibility (later renamed to `flatten_imports!`).
- **Apps relocate per-app handlers**
  ([#4476](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4476)):
  per-app `server_fn` and client UI moved from `commands/templates/...`
  into `apps/<app>/`. Update existing apps by relocating the matching
  source files; `reinhardt new` already emits the new layout.
- **`ClientLauncher::on_navigate`**
  ([#4117](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4117)):
  client SPA navigation now hooks through `Router::on_navigate` rather
  than launching a fresh router per navigation; remove any manual
  `ClientLauncher::launch` wiring tied to the old model.
- **`admin_routes_with_di()`**
  ([#3626](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3626)):
  use `admin_routes_with_di()` instead of the deprecated
  `admin_routes()` so middleware-contributed DI registrations are
  applied.

[Release-category Discussions](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/categories/release).

### Added

#### ORM & Database

- `#[model]` derives Django-style model traits, including
  `Model::build()` typestate constructor, `ForeignKey<T>` and
  `ManyToMany<T>` relations, and `#[field(skip = true)]` for non-DB
  fields.
- Multi-backend support: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and CockroachDB
  via TestContainers in tests; per-backend `ALTER COLUMN` dispatch and
  CockroachDB sentinel-row locks replace generic advisory-lock paths.
- Schema autodetection covers unique constraints, M2M relations, and
  qualified `to_model = "app::Model"` references; M2M autodetection
  keys on `table_name` and snake-cases through-tables consistently.
- `reinhardt-query`: in-house SQL builder wrapping SeaQuery, used in
  place of raw SQL across the workspace.
- Prefetch and `filter_by_target` honour canonical M2M naming rules.

#### URL Routing & Apps

- `#[url_patterns]` macro generates typed `urls::*` helpers per app
  with compile-time path verification; `#[routes]` consumes them.
- `#[viewset]` macro for REST-style endpoint groups; named, mount,
  and unified routing modes.
- `VersionedRouter` trait and `RouteVersionInfo` value type share a
  router abstraction between `reinhardt-urls` and `reinhardt-rest`
  without circular crate dependencies (introduced via
  `reinhardt-router`).
- Middleware DI registrations propagate through `with_middleware`,
  `group()`, and `pending_di` queues so the router rebuilds DI no
  matter the builder order.

#### Dependency Injection

- `Depends<T>` smart wrapper with caching, cycle detection, and
  metadata; `#[inject]` parameters express dependencies declaratively.
- `Middleware::di_registrations` hook + type-erased DI APIs allow
  middleware to contribute its own dependencies (e.g., `SessionStore`
  auto-registered by `SessionMiddleware`).
- `DependencyRegistration` is const-compatible for Rust 2024 edition.
- Testing helpers: `register_override` with `OverrideGuard`, and the
  `with_di_overrides!` macro shipped from `reinhardt-testkit-macros`.

#### Pages, WASM, and Server Functions

- `page!` declarative DSL for component bodies (70+ HTML elements
  validated at compile time) with `if`/`else`, `for`, `watch`, and
  reactive `Signal<T>` bindings.
- `head!` macro for SSR head metadata.
- `form!` macro: typed form fields, widgets, validators (client &
  server), CSRF protection, two-way Signal binding, computed values,
  field groups, slots, and dynamic `choices_loader`.
- `#[server_fn]` macro generates the WASM client stub and the
  server-side handler; codec selection (`json`, `url`, `msgpack`).
- `use_router()` hook, `RouterHandle`, `navigate()` free function,
  and `try_with_spa_router` for graceful SPA fallback.
- HMR (`reinhardt-pages` feature flag): WebSocket-driven CSS / DOM
  patching, scheme selected automatically based on
  `window.location.protocol`.

#### HTTP, REST, and Middleware

- `reinhardt-http` request / response abstractions; sanitization
  helpers (`validate_html_attr_name`, `is_safe_url`, anchor-link
  support, XSS prevention) and resource-limit configuration.
- `reinhardt-rest`: ViewSets with operation-level OpenAPI attributes,
  versioning via `VersioningSettings`, OpenAPI macros under
  `reinhardt-openapi-macros`.
- `reinhardt-middleware`: session middleware, CORS, gzip, etc.

#### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT + session-cookie auth, OAuth2 (`GenericOidcProvider` for
  arbitrary OIDC IdPs), and pluggable user managers.
- `SuperuserInit` trait and `SuperuserCreator` registry; auto-register
  via `inventory` for `#[user(full = true)]` + `#[model]` types.
- `AuthProtection` enum + `EndpointMetadata` propagate auth
  requirements; route macros detect auth parameters and produce the
  metadata automatically.

#### Admin Interface

- `#[model]`-driven admin pages with role-based permissions,
  type-safe query filters, and form-based CRUD.
- `reinhardt-admin-cli`: CLI for scaffolding admin pages,
  `cargo install --path crates/reinhardt-admin-cli` ships with the
  workspace.
- `admin_routes_with_di()` entry point + `AdminRoute` (now
  `#[non_exhaustive]`).

#### Configuration & Settings

- `SettingsBuilder` layered configuration with `TomlFileSource`,
  `EnvFileSource`, and typed interpolation enabled by default.
- `#[settings(...)]` macro requires explicit `CoreSettings` and emits
  `HasSettings<F>` impls for composed settings; `#[setting(...)]`
  attribute drives `field_policies()` generation.

#### Testing

- `reinhardt-test` fixtures for TestContainers-backed Postgres, MySQL,
  SQLite, CockroachDB, Redis, and Kafka instances.
- Module-scoped Kafka fixture with `KafkaConfig.partitions`.
- `reinhardt-testkit` and `reinhardt-testkit-macros` provide
  `with_di_overrides!` and `DiOverrideBuilder` for testing-only DI
  overrides.

#### Other Integrations

- GraphQL handler via `reinhardt-graphql` (+ macros).
- gRPC handler via `reinhardt-grpc` (+ macros).
- WebSocket router via `reinhardt-websockets`.
- Mail delivery via `reinhardt-mail` (pluggable transports).
- i18n via `reinhardt-i18n` (fluent-style messages).
- Throttling via `reinhardt-throttling`.
- Streaming integration via `reinhardt-streaming` (Kafka).
- Deep-link helpers via `reinhardt-deeplink`.
- Keyboard shortcuts via `reinhardt-shortcuts`.

#### Tooling & Examples

- `reinhardt new` scaffold emits the per-app layout matching
  [#4476](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4476).
- `examples-tutorial-basis` (Django-tutorial parity), `examples-rest`
  (REST-API tutorial with Bruno collections), and additional samples
  cover the most common entry points.

### Changed

- Cross-cutting refactor of the URL/routing macro internals for a
  smaller, easier-to-read generated TokenStream.
- ORM accessors and autodetector consolidate on a single
  `crate::naming::to_snake_case` source.
- Setting-related `glob` imports replaced with explicit `pub use`
  re-exports; explicit `rayon` trait imports.
- WASM compilation: client URL accessors namespaced per app on
  `wasm32`, with `#[cfg]` gating in generated tokens to avoid stale
  symbols.
- Migrations now dispatch `ALTER COLUMN TYPE` per backend (MySQL
  `MODIFY`, SQLite recreate, PostgreSQL / CockroachDB direct ALTER).

### Deprecated

- `Injected<T>` and `OptionalInjected<T>` — use `Depends<T>` /
  `Option<Depends<T>>` ([#3631](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3631)).
- `admin_routes()` — use `admin_routes_with_di()` ([#3626](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3626)).
- `JsonFileSource`, `auto_source` — use `TomlFileSource` ([#4120](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/4120)).
- `define_views!` — renamed to `flatten_imports!` ([#3783](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3783)).
- `#[export_endpoints]` — removed in favour of `define_views!` /
  `flatten_imports!` ([#3768](https://github.com/kent8192/reinhardt-web/discussions/3768)).

### Fixed

- WASM compatibility for the reactive runtime: `Signal<T>` is `Sync`
  on native via `Arc<RwLock<T>>`; `flush_updates` unifies pending
  effects.
- `#[routes]` no longer panics on `extern` identifiers; reserved-ident
  set excludes `extern`.
- `form!` macro: `on_success` and `success_url` correctly hoist
  before navigation; `watch` and `initial` capture outer scope.
- `#[user]` integration tests opt out of auto-manager when the
  fixture supplies one.
- Migrations: split multi-statement reverse SQL; emit `ALTER COLUMN`
  reverse as a single comma-separated statement.
- Static-files handler disables immutable caching for bundle assets
  in debug builds so HMR can replace them.
- Per-app `installed_apps` state file is namespaced by
  `CARGO_CRATE_NAME` so concurrent macro expansion does not race.
- Type-erased proc-macro closures use an `if false { ... }`
  dead-code branch with `unreachable!()` arguments to unify the
  user-supplied generic at compile time (#4624 / #4627).

### Security

- HTML attribute / URL sanitization helpers shipped to prevent the
  most common XSS sinks.
- CSRF protection wired into `form!` for non-GET methods.
- OAuth2 `exchange_code` requires an explicit `redirect_uri` so
  attacker-controlled callbacks cannot be substituted post-issue.

### Performance

- Single-lock manager operations in core-macros generated code.
- Per-app endpoint inventory keyed on `CARGO_CRATE_NAME` removes a
  contention point during macro expansion.
